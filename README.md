Deloitte Data Analyst Job Simulation

I recently participated in Deloitte's job simulation on the Forage platform, and
it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of the
team at Deloitte.
I was able to analyse data and create a dashboard. I practised using Tableau and
Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on technology problems
for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a team at a companyÂ like
Deloitte.
